Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
======

Hi, Iâ€™m Lei Xie. Iâ€™m passionate about exploring how signal processing and machine learning can make communication and sensing systems smarter and more efficient.

I received  my B.E. in Electronic Information Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2016, and my Ph.D. in Signal and Information Processing from UESTC in 2021. From 2021 to 2024, I worked as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST).

Beyond research, I enjoy learning new ideas, collaborating with curious minds, and building projects that connect theory with real-world impact. 

We are seeking candidates with a strong interest in Mathematics and its applications in Machine Learning and Communications.

Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to explore my work or reach out if youâ€™d like to connect! ðŸš€
